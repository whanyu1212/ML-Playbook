# ML-Playbook
A collection of notes and hands-on exercises for ML &amp; DL

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for hands-on applications.
- `data/`: Contains sample datasets used in the examples.
